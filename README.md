# FACE  MASK PREDICTION USING DEEP LEARNING 

## Inspiration:
we know that covid time has gone . But I am focusing on that time what is more important thing which is focused , yeah that is mask . Government had ordered that everybody applied mask on face to prevent yourself from covid-19. And face mask is not only  necessary in the covid time but its need is also in some busy cities like Delhi where lots of population due to vehicles. 

## Introduction:
This project involve building a model that is trained using some data set by applying deep learning concept and then make it for predicting the output for a face input that it is masked or not . 
This project involve deep learning ,CNN ,transfer learning and gradcam visualization and other concept of machine learning .
  
## Methodology:

This project has several step :
- Convert the images into numeric form 
- Then preprocessing the data 
- I will use transfer learning and for it I will use mobilenetv2  and make a base model 
- And after we use deep learning concept and make hidden layer.
- Make our model 
- Regularized our model
- And then train it
- Predict the test output 
- Then check the accuracy 
- And there are also  many  other steps in above 


## Goals:
  Mid Evaluation:
- To acquire the required skillset to build model .
- Gain greater experience of using ML algorithms,deep learning and transfer learning and CNN and other concept on practical datasets(from huggingface)
- Performing necessary data collection and data cleaning.
  
  ULTIMATE GOAL:
- To increase the accuracy of the prediction of the model.
- And make the model better so that its performance could become good .
